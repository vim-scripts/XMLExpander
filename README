Getting Started
********************
With the XMLExpander extension plugin for vim you can make your XML file
clear. The XMLExpander is a pretty printer for XML.

When you have the problem that your xml files are e.g. in one line or have not
clear insertions this plugin could help you. After running the XMLExpander
every opening and ending tag is in one line and have clear insertions.

First install the plugin: |xmlexpander-install|

To run the XMLExpander do the following:
- load the input XML file
- execute the XMLExpander: menu Plugin->XMLExpander <run>

Now you have a pretty printed XML file (in the same VIM window!).

For further details read the vim help file doc/xmlexpander.txt
or in VIM :help xmlexpander

Warning:
The XML File must be syntactical correct! The script do not check this.
